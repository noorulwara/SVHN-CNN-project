# SVHN Project
This project focuses on Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset, a real-world image dataset for developing object recognition algorithms. The dataset contains images of house numbers extracted from Google Street View.

# Project Overview
This project involves:

Data exploration and visualization using Python and Jupyter Notebook
Preprocessing and feature extraction from the SVHN dataset
Building and evaluating machine learning models to classify house numbers
Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image recognition tasks
# Requirements
The following Python packages are required to run the notebook:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
tensorflow / keras
scikit-learn
You can install the required libraries by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt
# Dataset
The SVHN dataset can be downloaded from this link.

There are two formats of the dataset:

Format 1: The original images in .png format along with bounding boxes.
Format 2: Cropped digits centered in 32x32 images.
# Project Structure
SVHN project.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing code for loading data, preprocessing, and building models.
images/: Directory containing example images from the dataset.
models/: Saved machine learning models.
requirements.txt: List of required Python libraries.
# Model Architecture
The project uses a CNN-based architecture with layers such as:

Convolutional Layers for feature extraction
Pooling Layers for dimensionality reduction
Fully Connected Layers for classification
# Evaluation
The models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Results are plotted for training and validation phases.

# How to Run the Project
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/svhn-project.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd svhn-project
Run the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook SVHN project.ipynb
# Results
The final model achieves an accuracy of X% on the test set. The confusion matrix and other performance metrics are visualized in the notebook.

# Future Improvements
Further hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy.
Experimenting with different architectures like ResNet or VGG.
Data augmentation to improve model robustness.
